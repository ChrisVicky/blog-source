Hello, and welcome to my blog.

<!--I am a 20-year-old college student majoring in Computer Science who dreamed about designing a computer architecture that would contribute to the development of advanced technology. I once was a Windows user but was obsessed with Linux immediately after my very first installation of Ubuntu for my scientific research requirement. After about 3 months, when I learnt about the architecture and components of computers as well as the Operating System in school, I started to switch from Ubuntu to Arch Linux, which, until now, is my first choice every time I turn the power on.-->

<!--I said I was passionate and wanted to design computer architectures. However, as a college student with limited choices of topic and professors, the project that I have conducted is related to another area, UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) swam control, in which we proposed a de-centralised method and algorithm that enable a group of drones to explore an unknown environment and make decisions based on the algorithm that is embedded in every individual.-->

<!--Right now, I am involved in a project that develops a system with multiple technologies, which, from my point of view, shall be better for industrial rather than for scientific purposes since the idea and method we conducted are nothing special but rather old-school while the system that we design is somehow new to the industrial world to the best of our knowledge.-->

<!--All those experience of 'doing lab' and 'debuging' seems, from my point of view, to be a scientific skill training. That is, the knowledge is not the centric but the habit and lessons related to the insight of 'doing lab' is what I gains through it.-->

<!--Other experiences includes ACM and Web Backend Development will be written later.-->
